# Docker Example App

This is a bare-bones, dockerized [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application that demonstrates the configuration  outlined in the article ["Docker for an Existing Rails Application"](http://chrisstump.online/2016/02/20/docker-existing-rails-application/). You could use this code for a new Rails app that you want to use Docker with, or to easily follow along in the article.
